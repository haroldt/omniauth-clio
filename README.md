# OmniAuth clio

This gem contains the clio strategy for OmniAuth. I used the omniauth-twitter gem as a template to getting this up and running. Yay open source!!

clio uses the OAuth 2.0 flow, you can read about it here: http://api-docs.goclio.com/v1/index.html#authorization-with-oauth-2-0

## How To Use It

Usage is as per any other OmniAuth 2.0 strategy. So let's say you're using Rails, you need to add the strategy to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'omniauth-clio'

You can pull them in directly from github e.g.:

    gem 'omniauth-clio', :git => 'https://github.com/shicholas/omniauth-clio.git'

Once these are in, you need to add the following to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` if using a rails app:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :clio, ENV['client_key'], ENV['client_secret'] 
    end

If you are using Devise in conjunction with omniauth, add this to your devise.rb file that is generated by devise:

	config.omniauth :clio, ENV['client_key'], ENV['client_secret']


If you're just using something else that doesn't depend on Rack you can add this:
	use OmniAuth::Builder do
  		provider :cheddar, ENV['client_key'], ENV['client_secret']
	end


## Watch the RailsCast

Ryan Bates has put together an excellent RailsCast on OmniAuth which you can watch here: http://railscasts.com/episodes/241-simple-omniauth-revised

## Getting your API Key
To get an API Key from Clio you will need to follow these steps http://api-docs.goclio.com/v1/index.html#create-a-clio-account.

It is recommended you use environment variables to store your keys so that Clio can regonize your app. You can do so by using these shell commands:
export CLIO_CLIENT_KEY=...
export CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET=...
rails server

If you love Heroku as much as I do, you can use these commands to get it to work there:
heroku config:add CLIO_APP_KEY=...


## Supported Rubies

OmniAuth clio is tested under 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3 and Ruby Enterprise Edition. I used the simplecov gem, https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov, to help me determine this.


## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

- Fork the project.
- Make your feature addition or bug fix.
- Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
- Send me a pull request, thanks so much for your help!!
